A user interface for data collection usage.


Get Started:

Install git, node 8.x and npm 5.x.

Node could be found on https://nodejs.org/en/. Installing node here will usually install npm at the same time.

Git clone this project.

Go to the "pathadvisor-frontend-master" directory and run npx bolt for the first time. It will install all dependencies for the project and for all the plugins.

Then run npm start in the terminal to start the client.

The client would run locally now at http://localhost:3000.


How to use:

Right click on the position that the data would refer to. Click "Store 3D data at this position".

Check and adjust the "x","y" and "floor" parameter if needed.

Click on "Start collecting in real time here". An interface for data collection would prompt up.

Click on "choose file" and pick the desired data file. Then click on "send".
